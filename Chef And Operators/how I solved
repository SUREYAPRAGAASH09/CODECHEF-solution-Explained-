                                                                                  How I Solved

First of All we get the no of test case, we get process.
Next get A and B values.

For example , sample input :  10 20 means we need to verify that 
                    
                        "10 should be lesser  than 20" and 
                    not "10 should be greater than 20" and 
                    not "10 should be equal   than 20".
                    
likewise, for sample input 20 10 means we need to verify that 
                    
                        "10 should be greater than 20" and 
                    not "10 should be lesser  than 20" and 
                    not "10 should be equal   than 20".
                    
If any of the conditions not applied means -> the given input A and B must be equal to each other.
