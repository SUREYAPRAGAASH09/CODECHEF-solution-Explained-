                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                Chef And Operators - How I Solved

Problem Statement :  
											
	Chef has just started Programming, he is in first year of Engineering. Chef is reading about Relational Operators.
	Relational Operators are operators which check relatioship between two values. 
	Given two numerical values A and B you need to help chef in finding the relationship between them that is,
	First one is greater than second or,
	First one is less than second or,
	First and second one are equal.
 

Input : 
	First line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of testcases. Each of the T lines contain two integers A and B.

Output :
	For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains any one of the relational operators
	'<' , '>' , '='.

Sample Test cases :

	Input:
		3
		10 20
		20 10
		10 10

	Output:
		<
		>
		=

My Approch :  

    First of All we get the no of test case, we get process.
    Next get A and B values.

    For example , sample input :  10 20 means we need to verify that 

                            "10 should be lesser  than 20" and 
                        not "10 should be greater than 20" and 
                        not "10 should be equal   than 20".

    likewise, for sample input 20 10 means we need to verify that 

                            "10 should be greater than 20" and 
                        not "10 should be lesser  than 20" and 
                        not "10 should be equal   than 20".

    If any of the conditions not applied means -> the given input A and B must be equal to each other.
