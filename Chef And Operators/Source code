									Chef And Operators

Problem Statement :  
											
	Chef has just started Programming, he is in first year of Engineering. Chef is reading about Relational Operators.
	Relational Operators are operators which check relatioship between two values. 
	Given two numerical values A and B you need to help chef in finding the relationship between them that is,
	First one is greater than second or,
	First one is less than second or,
	First and second one are equal.
 

Input
	First line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of testcases. Each of the T lines contain two integers A and B.

Output
	For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains any one of the relational operators
	'<' , '>' , '='.

Sample Test cases :

	Input:
		3
		10 20
		20 10
		10 10

	Output:
		<
		>
		=

Source code : 
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main() {
		int T, A, B, i;
		cin >> T;

		for (i=0; i<T; i++)
		{
		    cin >> A >> B;

		    if ( (A < B) && !(A > B) && !(A == B) )
			std::cout << "<" << std::endl;
		    else if ( (A > B) && !(A < B) && !(A == B) )
			std::cout << ">" << std::endl;
		    else
			std::cout << "=" << std::endl;

		}
		return 0;
	}
